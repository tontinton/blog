Thanks for visiting my blog!

I'm Tony Solomonik, a programmer who loves inherent complexity but hates incidental complexity.

I'm mainly interested in operating systems, compilers, performance, networking and security / reverse engineering.

My blog posts will mainly be about taking a complicated problem and breaking it apart into the fundemantal "axioms" that make it up, in a non-academic and human-friendly manner.
